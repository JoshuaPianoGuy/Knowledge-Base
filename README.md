# Knowledge-Base
University assignment where a text file of information can be loaded, and the user can search for terms, sentences about terms or load in information.
Seeing that this is a user-interactive knowledge base,  there is also a fun fact option that returns a random piece of information form the knowledge base.

There are 2 text files with information, called Knowledge.txt and Knowledge-additional.txt. Both come from: https://allenai.org/data/genericskb. These files are extracts of the entire knowledge base.
